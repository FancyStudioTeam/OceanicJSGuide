## Using Environment Variables

The Environment Variables are variables that are declared outside the execution process, which are declared with the structure of Key/Value.

To use Environment Variables in your code, you will have to use a global variable named `process.env`.

:::danger
This is not a secure way to set your token, this is just an example of how to use Environment Variables.
:::

```js title="Using process.env variable" frame="terminal"
console.log(
  process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN
); /* Output: undefined (Because it has not been set) */

/*
  This will set a new property on the env object
  Which its name will be "DISCORD_TOKEN" and its value will be "XXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXX"
*/
process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN = "XXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXX";

console.log(process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN); /* Output: XXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXX */
```

To store your token in a secure way, you will have to create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.

<FileTree>

- discord-bot
  - node_modules/
  - **.env**
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json

</FileTree>

```bash title=".env" frame="code"
DISCORD_TOKEN = "XXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXX" # Your bot token
```

:::danger
The `.env` file must always be kept private, because it is where we store all our secret variables.

If you use git, be sure to ignore this file before uploading it to GitHub.

```text title=".gitignore" frame="code"
.env
```

:::

## Loading Environment Variables

To load the Environment Variables, you will have to use a dependency named `dotenv`.

```bash title="Installing Dotenv" frame="terminal"
npm install dotenv
```

This dependency will load all the Environment Variables from your `.env` file.

```js title="Using Dotenv" frame="terminal"
console.log(
  process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN
); /* Output: undefined (Because it has not been loaded) */

/*
  This will load the environment variables stored in our .env file
  Make sure you have this function at the top of your main file
*/
require("dotenv").config();

console.log(process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN); /* Output: XXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXX */
```

## Creating the Main File

To create your bot base, you will have to create a new file named `index.js`.

<FileTree>

- discord-bot
  - node_modules/
  - .env
  - **index.js** Main file
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json

</FileTree>

```js title="index.js" frame="code" "IMPORTANT" "auth: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN"
/* Loading Environment Variables */
require("dotenv").config();

/* Importing the classes we are going to use */
const { Client } = require("oceanic.js");

/*
  Creating the client instance

  IMPORTANT: In the "auth" option, we must put the "Bot" prefix before the token, as it appears in the example
  If in the value of the "DISCORD_TOKEN" Environment Variable you already have the "Bot" prefix, you can put it as auth: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN directly
*/
const client = new Client({
  auth: `Bot ${process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN}`,
  gateway: {
    intents: ["GUILDS"] /* For now, you will use the GUILDS intent */,
  },
});

/* Connect the bot to Discord */
client.connect();

/*
  We listen to the "Ready" event
  When the bot is ready, it will send a message to the console
*/
client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log(`${client.user.username} has been connected to Discord!`);
});

/*
  We listen to the "Error" event
  If there is no event for errors, it may cause an UncaughtError to be thrown, causing the process to die
*/
client.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

:::note
Execute the `node index.js` command in your terminal to start your bot process.

```bash title="Initializing your bot process" frame="terminal"
node index.js # Expected Output: Guide Bot has been connected to Discord!
```

If a message similar to `[YOUR_BOT_NAME] has been connected to Discord!` appears in the terminal, it means that your bot has been initialized without problems.
