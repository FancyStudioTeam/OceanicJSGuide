## Creating the Project

To create your bot, you will have to create a new folder named `discord-bot` (or another name) on your Desktop.

<FileTree>
- Desktop
  - **discord-bot/**

</FileTree>

## Configuring your Project

Once you have created the folder, you will have to open the folder with your Code Editor.

To start setting up the project, you will have to initialize the `package.json` file.

:::note
The npm command comes by default when you install Node.js.
:::

```bash title="Initializing the package.json file" frame="terminal"
npm init -y # This will create a new file named package.json
```

<FileTree>

- discord-bot
  - **package.json**

</FileTree>

You can learn more about the `package.json` file in the [NPM Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Installing Oceanic.js

Once you have the `package.json` file initialized, you will have to install `oceanic.js`.

```bash title="Installing Oceanic.js" frame="terminal" "No Voice"
# No Voice API support
npm install oceanic.js --omit=optional

# Voice API support
npm install oceanic.js --include=optional
```

Once you have installed `oceanic.js`, a new file named `package-lock.json` and a new folder named `node_modules` will be created.

<FileTree>

- discord-bot
  - **node_modules/**
  - **package-lock.json**
  - package.json

</FileTree>
