## Token Importance

The token is the credential on which **the bot uses to authorize into Discord and perform requests**.

The token is a very sensitive credential that must be kept private and secure.

:::danger
If the token has been leaked, you should go as quickly as possible to the Discord Developer Portal to reset the token, making the current token invalid.

Be sure to replace the old token with the new one.
